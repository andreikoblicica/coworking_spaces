                If you follow our journey since the beginning, or if it is the first time you read one of our blog posts, there is one thing you need to know about us. Over the last 5 years, and following our first encounter with coworking back in 2015 in Berlin, we’ve decided to focus our time and effort in understanding why and how people start coworking spaces around the world. <br>

                While at first, we started to travel around Europe, opportunities to go further came our way. Hence, since we started, we’ve had the chance to visit 420 coworking spaces across 47 cities from Tokyo to New York. 

                <br><br>And it is actually in New York that things took a turn for us. Back in 2017, while visiting a coworking space called Based In and chatting with its founder Tomas about his story and ours, he ended our chat with a sentence: “You guys have seen so much, you should really write a book!” The idea surely sounded appealing when we heard it for the first time, but because we were rather focused on trying to build Coworkies and connect members from coworking spaces globally, we didn’t go home and start writing. 

                <br><br>Continuing our journey to new cities and spaces, this idea of making a book started to come more and more on the table. At some point, pretty much every meeting we were going out of was ending with “so when is the book coming out?” or “will you make a book about your journey?”. Seeing the people we were meeting projecting themselves into the idea of a book, felt like what we call in the startup world “a product-market fit”. 

                <br><br>Iterating on the idea, we started to think about the kind of book we would like to bring to the world. Should it be online, offline, what kind of content should we put in it, for who would we be making it, etc… 

                <br><br>Somehow, all the answers came naturally to us, leading me to how we made it happen.

                    Once we knew we wanted to write a book, the first thing we had to decide was whether we would do a physical book or an online one. While this is an eternal debate, the answer, in our case, became very evident: “Around The World in 250 Coworking Spaces” would be a coffee table book. 

                    <br><br>Why? 

                    <br><br>Looking at the content and resources available for people interested in coworking and, more generally, the flexible workspace’s world, we understood pretty much everything was online. Our thinking, through this book, was to offer any reader the possibility to really take a moment to dive into the topic, take notes, let her/his mind wander while experiencing something at a slower pace. In a fast-paced world, where people are bombarded with content on their phone or computer all the time, we wanted to offer them a moment to pause, learn and (or) reflect, leading us to the decision to make an offline book.

                    The structure of the book was another journey in itself. Deciding how to tell the stories of all the spaces we met was not an easy task, nor the way to bring it together. But, as in everything, you have to start somewhere to know where to go and that’s what we did. 

                    <br><br>At first, we asked ourselves if we should take people on a travel journey through our own perspective: meaning, from one city to another, presenting the different spaces we visited with our own words. Although this sounded interesting at first, it is not what we opted for. 

                    <br><br>Through the book, we wanted to offer the spaces we met an opportunity to tell their stories, in their own words and with their own perspective. Why such a choice? Through our different encounters with coworking founders and coworking teams, they transmitted to us their passion and dedication in bringing their coworking, coliving or makerspaces to life. Hence, the book needed to be a vessel for them to share their passion, their entrepreneurial journey with all it implied: the good and the lessons learned along the way.
